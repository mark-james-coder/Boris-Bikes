# Boris Bikes 
## (Makers Academy - Week 1 Afternoon Challenge)

## Description: 

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality. There were many User Stories that needed to be satisfied in order to complete this challenge.

This pair-programming challenge was completed through a TDD process using Ruby and Rspec, and incorporated doubles and mocks.
